The Phantom's Trail: Unveil the Hidden Key
Objective
You’ve been called in to continue the work of a previous pentester who had to leave unexpectedly. This pentester had already begun an investigation into Mastame, a company shrouded in mystery. During their work, they uncovered several users linked to the company, scattered across social media.

Your mission begins where they left off: performing OSINT on these users to gather information and uncover credentials that will grant you access to an FTP server. From there, your journey deep into the system begins, with the ultimate goal of finding the hidden flag.

Challenge Stages
Stage 1: OSINT on Mastame Users
Begin by investigating the digital footprints of the six Mastame users on Instagram. The clues they leave behind may contain the credentials needed to access the FTP server. Only by piecing together this information will you be able to proceed.

Stage 2: Discovering the Clues
With the FTP credentials in hand, access the server. There’s valuable information hidden here, and your first task is to find it.

Stage 3: Finding the Key
Once inside the FTP server, locate a key. This key will allow you to access the user jony’s account, which is necessary to advance.

Stage 4: Activating the Web Server
In jony’s account, you’ll find a web server that isn’t running. Start the server to unlock the next part of your journey.

Stage 5: Retrieving Credentials
With the server running, locate the credentials that will allow you to log into another user’s account.

Stage 6: Gaining Control
Using the newly discovered credentials, access another user’s account. Here, you’ll need to perform additional research, make changes, and gain control of the system.

Stage 7: Finding the Flag
Finally, in the root user’s directory, there is a file containing the flag. This file is your goal—find it to complete the challenge. To retrieve the flag, you’ll need to use the password from the previous user’s account.

Winning Condition
Submit the final flag to complete the challenge.

Final Notes
The trail left by the first pentester is your guide, but it’s up to you to uncover the hidden secrets and complete the mission.
